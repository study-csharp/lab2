#Lab 2: Methods

In this lab, you will be creating a class to represent a jobseeker's profile. This class will store essential information, including the jobseeker's first name, last name, and a list of work experience records. Each work experience record should include details such as position, organization, start and end years, and a category (e.g., IT, finance, etc.).

Task 1: Create the Jobseeker Profile Class

Write a class, named "JobseekerProfile," that encapsulates the jobseeker's data as described above.

Task 2: Implement a Method for Full Name

Add a method to the class that returns the jobseeker's full name, where the first name and last name are separated by a space.

Task 3: Calculate Average Duration per Workplace

Implement a method within the class that calculates the average duration a jobseeker spends at each workplace in their work experience records.

Task 4: Calculate Average Duration per Workplace (with Minimum Duration)

Extend the class by adding a method that calculates the average duration per workplace, but this time, consider only those work experience records with a duration greater than or equal to a specified minimum duration, which will be provided as a parameter to the method.
